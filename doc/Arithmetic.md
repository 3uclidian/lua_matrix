All the basic arithmetic operations should work with their usual definitions.
For matrices `m` and `n` and number `num` the following is valid
```lua
a = m+n
b = m-n
c = -m
d = m * n -- if m and n are the correct size to be multiplied
e = m * num
f = num * m
g = m / num
h = m ^ num -- if num is a non-negative integer
```
